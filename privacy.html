                   <p>This website is operated by Happi PTE LTD. (hereinafter, “Happi”, “We”, or “Us”). This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs your access to the Happi website: https://www.us.happirewards.com/ any other and any other web services owned, controlled, or offered by Happi now or in the future (all collectively referred to as, the “Services”). The term “You” or “User” shall refer to any individual that views, uses, accesses, browses or submits any content or material to the Services. </p>
                   <p>Since we may gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This Privacy Policy discloses what information we gather and how we use it. The private information you provide on the Services will be used only for its intended purpose.</p>
                   <p>BY VISITING, SIGNING UP, USING, BROWSING, OR ACCESING THE SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE DATA PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS STATEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
                   <p>ABOUT HAPPI</p>
                   <p>The Happi app is a platform for consumer insights and interactions. As such, users receive questions regarding their status, history, intentions, opinions, preferences, and desires on a broad range of consumer, economic, political, religious and lifestyle topics. Happi collects this information on behalf of clients with the intention of selling the information to those clients. These clients may be consumer brands, market research organizations, financial services providers, political groups, employers, media and/or non-profit organizations. </p>
                   <p>This information can be used for analysis by clients or Happi and may form the basis of targeting additional questions or promotions to you. Happi does not release personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses or mobile numbers. Happi does not enable third parties to contact you directly other than through questions and promotions through the Services. If you respond to a promotion and choose to offer your personal information to any third party, the terms and conditions of your provision of that information to the third party are between you and the third party. One of the user benefits of Happi is access to promotions aligned with the opinions, preferences and desires you indicate through question responses and prize selections. You understand and confirm consent to receiving promotions, invitations, offers, and additional questions through the Services based on your responses to questions and selection of prizes on the Services.</p>
                   <p>You further confirm that if you are below 18 years of age, your parent or guardian has confirmed both awareness and consent for you to use this app. We do not collect personal information of children under the age of thirteen (13).</p>
                   <p>HOW DOES THE HAPPI WORK?</p>
                   <p>After verification of your account, you will receive profiling questions via the Services survey module. Your responses to these questions will determine which market research studies are best suited for you. When we find a study suited for you, we will ask if you want to participate via survey, push notification or by calling or emailing you. Some studies involve monitoring of your mobile activity, the advertisements to which you are exposed and/or your location. We will explain the compliance expectations, the data to be collected, and the rewards for participation so that you can decide if you wish to participate. If you opt-in to a study, the Services will then guide you through a set up process to grant the necessary permissions and access rights to the Services. We will only use the data collected from registration, surveys, and monitoring as described in this Policy. Participants are invited to the Program by advertisements on social media, job boards, and through internal Refer-a-Friend programs or other third-party companies which are each the data controller of their respective data and Participants. Taking part in the Program is entirely voluntary. For more information on how the Happi works please read our Terms and Conditions.</p>
                   <p>By signing up to the Program, and by accepting these terms, you confirm that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Policy. We ask you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means any information which relates to an identifiable living individual.</p>
                   <p>This Policy does not replace the existing privacy policy of the Panels as that still applies to all Participants, whether or not they choose to participate in this Program. This Policy is supplemental to any panel-specific policies and applies only to those Participants who choose to participate in the Program.</p>
                   <p>This Policy describes our data collection and use practices for consumers who download the Application. This Policy applies only to the operation of the Services and not to any other application, website or service. </p>
